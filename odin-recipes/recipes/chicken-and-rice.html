        <h4>This creamy chicken and rice soup is comforting and delicious. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it gets!</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>

            <li>2 cups uncooked brown rice</li>
                
            <li>1 ½ cups chopped celery</li>
                
            <li>1½ cups chopped onion</li>
                
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder</li>
                
            <li>1 cup butter or margarine</li>
                
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                
            <li>6 cups milk, divided </li>

            <li>3 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>
                
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine broth, rice, celery, onions, water, and bouillon in a large pot over high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>

            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat; gradually add flour, stirring continuously to make a thick paste. Whisk in 4 cups of milk, 1/2 cup at a time, whisking constantly, until smooth.</li>

            <li>Stir sauce and chopped chicken into rice mixture; add some or all of the remaining 2 cups of milk to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper; simmer over low heat, stirring every 15 minutes, for 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
