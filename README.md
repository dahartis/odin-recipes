This is my first project for the Odin Project
I was still wrapping my head around Commits and Commit Messages so I didnt not include any during my writing of the code
In this project I was tasked with creating an index page that had a heading and links to 3 different recipes that I put in an unordered list
On the recipe pages I added a heading with and image and description
I rezied the original image and gave it an alt
Then a smaller heading for ingredients and cooking steps
Under the ingredients heading I created an unordered list of all ingredients needed
Under the "steps" heading I created and ordered list of the instructions for cooking the dish
